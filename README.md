Adapters is a collection of useful HTTP middleware or "Adapters". They follow the Adapter Pattern described by Mat Ryer in his blog post [Writing middleware in #golang and how Go makes it so much fun.](https://medium.com/@matryer/writing-middleware-in-golang-and-how-go-makes-it-so-much-fun-4375c1246e81)

Adapters can be chained in many ways (e.g. with [Alice](https://github.com/justinas/alice) or [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux#middleware)) because they all implement `func (http.Handler) http.Handler`.
